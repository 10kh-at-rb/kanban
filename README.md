Kanban
======

Kanban is a work-in-progress Trello clone I developed for a final project at [App Academy](http://appacademy.io), a 9-week Ruby on Rails and JavaScript web development intensive in San Francisco.

Kanban is built with Ruby on Rails on the backend, functioning essentially as a JSON API for Backbone.js on the frontend.

I have a demo hosted here on Heroku (database is reset daily):
